# __**Hey Toolbox Community…**__
As the year comes to an end, we have some sad news to share… After much thought and consideration, we’re are making the difficult decision to **move away from the Toolbox application**.  


## What’s happening with Toolbox?  
The future of the Toolbox app remains uncertain. With mrarm possibly stepping away from development and life pulling us all in different directions, Toolbox, as we’ve known it, has become a cherished piece of history.  


## Why this decision and what now?  
While Toolbox brought us together and will always hold a special place in our hearts, we believe it’s time to embrace a new path. This community has always been more than an app—it’s always been about the people, the memories, the bonds we’ve formed, **the community**. That said, we’re transitioning into something new, a space where we can honor our roots whilst building something uniquely ours.

We are still working out the rebrand, but it will perfectly encapsulates everything Toolbox has meant to us. It will reflect not just the app and game that united us—Toolbox & Minecraft—but also the laughter, competitiveness, drama, and all the ups and downs that make our history so meaningful. It’s a tribute to our journey, a nod to where we started, and a celebration to where we’re heading.

We know change isn’t always easy, and saying goodbye to the name “Toolbox” is for sure without a doubt bittersweet. But this new chapter gives us the chance to create something fresh while still honoring the legacy of the app, the community, and MrArm’s incredible contributions.

More details about this transition, including the new name and what’s to come, will be shared soon.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. Your support, memories, and passion are what make this community so special. Together, let’s make this next chapter just as meaningful as the last.

Sincerely,  
**Toolbox Team**
